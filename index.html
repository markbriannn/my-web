    <p class="message"> Happy National Girlfriend Day, Langga.
I may not have the perfect words, but I just want to say thank you, thank you for always being there for me. Your presence, your patience, and your love mean everything to me.

I love you deeply not just when things are easy, but especially when things are hard. Even when you pick little fights with me at night, I never stop loving you. In fact, those moments remind me how real and raw our connection is. And through it all, my heart never changes. I still choose you, every single day.

I don’t ever want to lose you. You’re not just part of my life you’ve become my safe space, my peace, my home. This is my last shot at love, and I’m giving it all to you, because I believe in us.

That’s all I really wanted to say today, Langga.
I love you. truly, deeply, and always.. 💖</p>
